# LLM Detect - AI Generated Text Identification

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the "LLM Detect - AI Generated Text Identification" Kaggle competition, hosted by Vanderbilt University and The Learning Agency Lab. This challenge tasks participants with building a model to discern essays written by middle and high school students from those generated by large language models (LLMs). As LLMs become more prevalent, concerns about their impact on education and the potential for plagiarism grow. The competition is accessible [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-detect-ai-generated-text).
